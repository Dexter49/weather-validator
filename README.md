## Overview

Hey there!

Alright, so this Weather CLI app is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and it was a test exercise I saw on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-weather-app-cli/#step-1-get-access-to-a-suitable-weather-api) 


In the project link above, you'd find a step-by-step guide on how to build the project from the ground up as well as every resource you would need to start and finish the CLI app

So, have a blast💪🏽⚡🚀🔥
